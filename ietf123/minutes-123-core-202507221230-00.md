<p><abbr title="Carsten Bormann">CB</abbr> presenting.</p>
<p><abbr title="Carsten Bormann">CB</abbr> (p1): Back at the beginning of the WG: we can't use HTML, we can't<br>
use HTTP, but we <em>can</em> use URIs ... well, we still use them, but there<br>
are things to do.</p>
<p><abbr title="Carsten Bormann">CB</abbr> (p2): Default value for the CoAP option Uri-Host. Over TLS, SNI<br>
influences the default value (originally the destination IP address of<br>
the request) in <a href="/doc/rfc8323/">RFC 8323</a> (for "CoAP over TLS", we didn't want to change<br>
<a href="/doc/rfc7252/">RFC 7252</a>).<br>
<abbr title="Carsten Bormann">CB</abbr> (p3-4): Now that SNI is more widely used, I wish that we had made<br>
that the default for DTLS too. Proposal: Update <a href="/doc/rfc7252/">RFC 7252</a>. (Not a<br>
clarification: the text was clear, we just do not like what it (doesn't)<br>
say anymore.) <br>
<abbr title="Carsten Bormann">CB</abbr> (p5): Should we just change the text? What is the impact on<br>
deployments? Is that an issue for implementations? We have to find out<br>
whether new semantics apply. It is ugly. Can we couple this with<br>
explicitly considering DTLS 1.3 too? (<a href="/doc/rfc7252/">RFC 7252</a> is explicitly about 1.2,<br>
we will have to write <em>something</em>.) Opinions are welcome.</p>
<p><abbr title="Christian Amsüss">CA</abbr>: If we ask what people deployed, we can also ask people who deployed<br>
DTLS 1.2 if anything in their implementation cares about the Uri-Host<br>
option. Many implementations ignore those things, e.g., when using CoAP<br>
in LwM2M. I suggest evaluating the impact on existing implementations<br>
and deployments.<br>
<abbr title="Carsten Bormann">CB</abbr>: What you say may soften the impact of a change.<br>
<abbr title="Christian Amsüss">CA</abbr> (in chat): It's not easy to get a good DTLS implementation for<br>
constrained devices in the first place.</p>
<p><abbr title="Esko Dijk">ED</abbr>: We can start with thinking about implementations that use CoAP that<br>
I know about (Thread, mesh networking protocol). They are all based on<br>
DTLS 1.2, no SNI use at all. This would not impact them.<br>
<abbr title="Jaime Jiménez">JJ</abbr> (on chat): why is it hard to find a good dtls 1.2 implementation? Is<br>
it because of the constrainedness, the complexity? Just curious.<br>
<abbr title="Christian Amsüss">CA</abbr> (on chat): Most are geared toward WebRTC, and the few ones that are<br>
good and generic have small warts such as WolfSSL's implementation<br>
disabling the 7252 MTI algorithm by default because they consider it<br>
unsafe.<br>
<abbr title="Jaime Jiménez">JJ</abbr> (on chat): Very good insight, thank you!</p>
<p><abbr title="Carsten Bormann">CB</abbr> (p5): It's all in the issue #49, please comment there (or on the<br>
mailing list).</p>

<p><abbr title="Carsten Bormann">CB</abbr> switching seamlessly to -href (p6)</p>
<p><abbr title="Carsten Bormann">CB</abbr> (p7): The topic of the default value for the Uri-Host option comes<br>
back when considering the translation between CoAP messages and CRIs.<br>
<abbr title="Carsten Bormann">CB</abbr> (not on slides): Also, we have an explicit issue in<br>
<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-core-corr-clar/">draft-ietf-core-corr-clar</a> that would prefer not having that algorithm<br>
rewritten for every transport. A given authority component may mean<br>
different things for different transports. A PR is open, it needs work. </p>
<p><abbr title="Carsten Bormann">CB</abbr> (p8): Zone identifiers break things. That happened here too. I<br>
thought we solved it and <a href="/doc/rfc6874/">RFC 6874</a> defined how to include a zone<br>
identifier in a URI, but the browser implementers ignored it. That RFC<br>
is now obsoleted. So currently there is no way to include a zone<br>
identifier in a URI. CRIs do not have that syntax problem (no percentage<br>
encoding is used). Link-local addresses are important in many CRI<br>
applications, thus we keep zone identifiers in CRIs.<br>
<abbr title="Carsten Bormann">CB</abbr> (p9): The situation is in flux, with white areas on the map. Mike<br>
Bishop's review: "situation is in flux, but white areas don't have to be<br>
that large". We have a resolution PR, as to not translating such CRI<br>
references into URI references.<br>
<abbr title="Carsten Bormann">CB</abbr> (p9): People told me that they use zone IDs on IPv4 addresses.<br>
<abbr title="Carsten Bormann">CB</abbr> (p10): Zone identifiers are assumed to be UTF-8, although not<br>
everyone agrees with that due to complex history. We can keep that and<br>
clean the CDDL, thus allowing more things than before.<br>
<abbr title="Carsten Bormann">CB</abbr> (p11): The IESG approved RFC 6991bis, including IP with zone ID.</p>
<p><abbr title="Christian Amsüss">CA</abbr> (on chat): Not unhappy? I am unhappy about zone IDs going away. As<br>
long as you can say "localhost" or "10.0.0.1", there are just some URIs<br>
that can't meaningfully be sent over the network.</p>

<p><abbr title="Christian Amsüss">CA</abbr> (p1): Continuing with the topic that Martine started.<br>
<abbr title="Christian Amsüss">CA</abbr> (p2-4): Parallel perspectives: Web-links and DNS. Clients can<br>
discover means to reach a host.<br>
<abbr title="Christian Amsüss">CA</abbr> (p5): Example scenario: "Find temperature at /t of sensor1".<br>
<abbr title="Christian Amsüss">CA</abbr> (p6): Where is that (IP)? Client does name resolution, e.g., using<br>
DNS. ALPN originally came from TLS, but in the registry there are<br>
entries that do not come from there, so using it here makes things<br>
easier.<br>
<abbr title="Christian Amsüss">CA</abbr> (p7): Which transports are available? As a result of the lookup<br>
process, there is the need to also indicate what transport to use (e.g.,<br>
coap over TCP). It gets more complicated when it comes to considering<br>
other future IP-based transport, which will not get a coap+X scheme.<br>
<abbr title="Christian Amsüss">CA</abbr> (p8): If we had a hypothetical CoAP over QUIC, then ALPN could be<br>
used to indicate that, e.g., with "ALPN: coqu".<br>
<abbr title="Christian Amsüss">CA</abbr> (p9): As a client, how do I know whom to talk to? This might also<br>
mean that I need to discover security information to use with the target<br>
peer. This can be encoded in the URI as <a href="http://hexhexhex.cred.service.arpa/t">hexhexhex.cred.service.arpa/t</a>,<br>
and in a "cred" ALPN parameter.<br>
<abbr title="Christian Amsüss">CA</abbr> (p10): Additional notes.<br>
<abbr title="Christian Amsüss">CA</abbr> (p11): We need feedback from the WG about the modeling, e.g., about<br>
what metadata we want to have and what belongs where. Does this fit with<br>
SVCB? How does DANE fit with SVCB?</p>
<p><abbr title="Mike Bishop">MB</abbr>: Not speaking as AD but as SVCB co-author.<br>
I don't think we have any precedent for a nonencrypted protocol being<br>
indicated by a SVCB record.<br>
I don't see a reason why it wouldn't work.<br>
You can have ALPN tokens and there is already one ALPN token reserved<br>
for an unencrypted protocol, h2c.<br>
I just filed an issue for you in your draft: h2c has a helpful note in<br>
the registry that says this should never actually appear in a TLS<br>
handshake.<br>
You probably want a similar note.<br>
Conceptually the way the way it works with HTTP is that if you ask for<br>
h1 or h2, then we're going to try over TCP with TLS.<br>
If you ask for h3, we're going to try over QUIC.<br>
So I think this follows a similar pattern: the ALPN token actually<br>
implies the transport<br>
Then what actual application layer protocol you pick over that transport<br>
might vary.<br>
In this case you only have one but I think conceptually this can work<br>
it's just novel.</p>
<p><abbr title="Esko Dijk">ED</abbr>: Do we need to consider that this may not be resolved via DNS?<br>
(That's not required by <a href="/doc/rfc7252/">RFC 7252</a>)<br>
<abbr title="Christian Amsüss">CA</abbr>: The list on p4 is not exhaustive. <br>
<abbr title="Christian Amsüss">CA</abbr>: There can be many ways for a system resolver to do this. DNS<br>
provides a good example. E.g., CoAP over GATT has mechanisms there (map<br>
a MAC address to a CoAP endpoint).</p>

<p><abbr title="Rikard Höglund">RH</abbr> presenting.</p>
<p><abbr title="Rikard Höglund">RH</abbr> (p2): KUDOS protocol: what and why.<br>
<abbr title="Rikard Höglund">RH</abbr> (p3): Components, nonces, using Z bit to indicate who has received<br>
which nonce.<br>
<abbr title="Rikard Höglund">RH</abbr> (p6): Recent changes; collisions are relevant in non-FS [FS =<br>
forward secrecy] mode where they can happen, and thus long random<br>
nonces are needed.<br>
<abbr title="Rikard Höglund">RH</abbr> (p7): More protections and interactions.<br>
<abbr title="Rikard Höglund">RH</abbr> (p8): State machine optimization / simplification: a complicated path<br>
is avoided by not transitioning back, if the peer can verify that the<br>
pair (nonce, X) has been processed this way already. It is easy to<br>
verify that, by comparing the derived OSCORE Master Salts.<br>
<abbr title="Rikard Höglund">RH</abbr> (p9): Next steps. Comments, reviews welcome!</p>
<p><abbr title="Rikard Höglund">RH</abbr> on ID update.</p>
<p><abbr title="Rikard Höglund">RH</abbr> (p2): We can update the OSCORE Sender ID and Recipient ID (plaintext<br>
identifiers!). Switching identifiers effectively switches keys. This<br>
mitigates privacy issues due to trivial message correlation on the event<br>
of a path switch (e.g., in case of network migration).<br>
<abbr title="Rikard Höglund">RH</abbr> (p3): Redesigned as based on an approach aligned with KUDOS. The<br>
newly offered Recipient ID is explicitly acknowledged by the other peer.<br>
The offer and the acknowledgement rely on two new CoAP options.<br>
<abbr title="Rikard Höglund">RH</abbr> (p4): After at least 2 sent id message and 3 received id-ack<br>
messages, it is done. The new OSCORE Security Context based on the new<br>
IDs can be used but should not be used yet; it is intended for use when<br>
a network switch occurs, and other identifying information changes too<br>
(e.g., addresses).<br>
<abbr title="Rikard Höglund">RH</abbr> (p4): Recipient IDs cannot be reused on a single key.<br>
<abbr title="Rikard Höglund">RH</abbr> (p7): Emphasize that new IDs should not be used on the old network<br>
segment.<br>
<abbr title="Rikard Höglund">RH</abbr> (p7): We also added some security considerations pointing out that<br>
you can track peers by looking at oscore partial IV (PIV) in the OSCORE<br>
option.<br>
If you see PIV 100 and then something pops up on a different network<br>
with PIV 101, it's quite likely that's actually the same peers<br>
transitioning to a new network.<br>
Fortunately because we're deriving a new OSCORE security context CTX_B<br>
is a brand new context with the new ids and that means the partial AV<br>
the sender sequence number resets back to zero.<br>
(And obviously there's other information that can be used to track the<br>
pairs you know like the network information.)<br>
So upon network migration you would hope to switch network address and<br>
also switching the link layer address because otherwise those could be<br>
used to to track the peers.</p>
<p><abbr title="Rikard Höglund">RH</abbr> (p8): Next steps. Plan to implement. Comments and reviews welcome!</p>

<p><abbr title="Marco Tiloca">MT</abbr> presenting as an individual.</p>
<p><abbr title="Marco Tiloca">MT</abbr> (p2): Recap and mechanism (information to participate in group<br>
observations is transported in error 5.03 responses).<br>
<abbr title="Marco Tiloca">MT</abbr> (p3): Updates in version -12: updated to use the CBOR type ~time for<br>
the "ending" parameter of the error informative response, thus being<br>
more granular when expressing the cancellation time of the group<br>
observation; generalization of the payload of the informative response<br>
and its semantics (other documents can use the same structure for<br>
different purposes, see, e.g.,<br>
<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-tiloca-t2trg-sw-update-groupcomm/">https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-tiloca-t2trg-sw-update-groupcomm/</a><br>
).<br>
<abbr title="Marco Tiloca">MT</abbr> (p4): More updates in version -12. Updated the CBOR type of one more<br>
parameter ("exp" also in the informative response, to be aligned with<br>
the change in "ending"), and corrected the name of another one.<br>
<abbr title="Marco Tiloca">MT</abbr> (p5): The biggest change is about the understanding of the transport<br>
to use, based on the pair (scheme, authority) in the CRIs specified in<br>
the error informative response. In general, the scheme alone is not<br>
sufficient to identify the transport anymore; we restructured on how<br>
transport is indicated and understood. Part of that was changing the<br>
structure of the newly defined IANA registry on transport for CoAP,<br>
which becomes simpler. This is also relevant for parsing details<br>
(specified in the "tp_details" parameter of the error informative<br>
response), based on transport used.<br>
<abbr title="Marco Tiloca">MT</abbr> (p6): Next steps, including discussion among authors on minor<br>
technical points. Plan to address two comments from IANA. The main big<br>
point is to split the document into two separate ones: a new one with<br>
all content related to proxies taken away from the present document; and<br>
the present one with the rest of the content (strong request at IETF 122<br>
in Bangkok).<br>
<abbr title="Marco Tiloca">MT</abbr> (p7): Split is being planned and can be now enforced. Question:<br>
should the new document about setup with proxies have intended status<br>
Informational (as suggested by <abbr title="Christian Amsüss">CA</abbr>)? Interested in other opinions.</p>
<p><abbr title="Marco Tiloca">MT</abbr>: Opinions on intended status from the Chairs?<br>
<abbr title="Carsten Bormann">CB</abbr>: If it does not have a normative intent, it is informational. It<br>
seems obvious to do that. As a high-level statement, let's make sure<br>
that our documents stay under 100 pages. Informational additions should<br>
not take over, I support this.<br>
<abbr title="Marco Tiloca">MT</abbr>: So Informational it is.</p>
<p><abbr title="Mike Bishop">MB</abbr> (as an individual): You are using 5.03 as response code for the<br>
informative error response. It is similar to HTTP and it is a server<br>
error. Looking what you are doing here, it is not really a server error<br>
though. Why do you use that response code?<br>
<abbr title="Marco Tiloca">MT</abbr>: It means service unavailable. If the server receives a traditional<br>
Observe request from a client, the server uses it to say: "I reject this<br>
request the way you want it (that service is not available) and I have<br>
something better to offer. Here's the information to participate in the<br>
better way".<br>
<abbr title="Mike Bishop">MB</abbr>: And CoAP does not have 3.00 (redirect), so ...<br>
<abbr title="Marco Tiloca">MT</abbr>: It is a redirect (3xx) in disguise, while are in fact forbidding<br>
actual redirection.</p>

<p><abbr title="Christian Amsüss">CA</abbr> (p2): This makes OSCORE responses effectively cacheable. We cannot<br>
cache with vanilla OSCORE, since each request is individually encrypted<br>
and the responses are bound to the requests. This new construct builds<br>
on Group OSCORE (<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-core-oscore-groupcomm/">draft-ietf-core-oscore-groupcomm</a>).<br>
<abbr title="Christian Amsüss">CA</abbr> (p3): What will cacheability cost? <br>
<abbr title="Christian Amsüss">CA</abbr> (p4): Luckily not too much: replay protection and source<br>
authentication of the protected Deterministic Requests. Replay<br>
protection is moot anyway in this case, since this is about cacheable<br>
resource representations (e.g., retrieved with the GET method). Source<br>
authentication is now bound to the single "virtual" Deterministic Client<br>
that any real client in the group can act as. Freshness is limited and<br>
request privacy is limited (a proxy needs some information). We hope<br>
that applications that want caching can make these trade-offs.<br>
<abbr title="Christian Amsüss">CA</abbr> (p5): What happens to OSCORE when there is no source authentication<br>
of requests? This uses deterministic requests with best-effort<br>
determinism. Key material is needed that multiple parties can use, but<br>
there is no AEAD nonce reuse.<br>
<abbr title="Christian Amsüss">CA</abbr> (p6): Describing the different mechanisms used. One specific<br>
particular message will be encrypted with a specific key.<br>
<abbr title="Christian Amsüss">CA</abbr> (p7): Which AEAD algorithms are deterministic? All of the current<br>
ones. We would like more eyes on the security: is it relevant anywhere<br>
to have constant-time operations? Does anyone need more text in Section<br>
2?<br>
<abbr title="Christian Amsüss">CA</abbr> (p8): We had a successful interop test between Marco's implementation<br>
for Californium and my implementation for aiocoap. The draft includes<br>
test vectors based on that.</p>
<p><abbr title="Robert Moskowitz">RM</abbr> (in chat): Is MLS possible here for shared crypto? Or is it too big<br>
objects to transmit for key setup?<br>
<abbr title="Robert Moskowitz">RM</abbr>: I have seen too many shared key protocols. MLS is the only one<br>
mathematically sound... Lots of things to leverage to share keys<br>
cheaply, but you pay in other ways.<br>
<abbr title="Christian Amsüss">CA</abbr>: I need to read up on MLS. <br>
<abbr title="Robert Moskowitz">RM</abbr>: MLS derives one key that can be used to encrypt data between<br>
multiple parties.<br>
<abbr title="Christian Amsüss">CA</abbr>: We already have a key shared between multiple parties (from Group<br>
OSCORE).</p>

<p><abbr title="Carles Gomez">CG</abbr> (p2): Revision -04 addresses various feedback.<br>
<abbr title="Carles Gomez">CG</abbr> (p3): Updated ToC with new and modified sections.<br>
<abbr title="Carles Gomez">CG</abbr> (p4): Payload length information. Considered defining header<br>
parameter for Bundle Protocol (BP), but it will not work for other<br>
transports like UDP. We defined a CoAP option Payload-length. This<br>
option is now unsafe to forward.<br>
<abbr title="Carles Gomez">CG</abbr> (p5): The Payload-length option will be class U for OSCORE. When<br>
using OSCORE, the Payload-length option will contain the OSCORE message<br>
payload size.<br>
<abbr title="Carles Gomez">CG</abbr> (p6): Message aggregation in supporting proxies, which may<br>
disaggregate and aggregate. The diagram could represent clients on<br>
Earth, proxy in Mars orbit, and servers on Mars.<br>
<abbr title="Carles Gomez">CG</abbr> (p7): We added a section about implementation status. The main<br>
implementation is Space CoAP. (Note: other implementations exist but<br>
they did not implement the Payload-length as they predate it)<br>
<abbr title="Carles Gomez">CG</abbr> (p8): Security considerations: listing risks and possible solutions. </p>
<p><abbr title="Carles Gomez">CG</abbr> (p9): Want to ask for WG adoption.</p>
<p><abbr title="Christian Amsüss">CA</abbr> (in chat): Those security considerations almost sound excessive: If<br>
things were not aggregated, the lengths would be just as visible.</p>
<p><abbr title="Esko Dijk">ED</abbr>: Did you consider bundling other protocols like CoAP + something or<br>

<p><abbr title="Marco Tiloca">MT</abbr> presenting as individual.</p>
<p><abbr title="Marco Tiloca">MT</abbr> (p1): For OSCORE and Group OSCORE, this encrypts the Partial IV in<br>
the OSCORE option.<br>
<abbr title="Marco Tiloca">MT</abbr> (p2): Mostly in requests, as the Partial IV is less common in<br>
responses while it is a must in requests. The OSCORE option is overall<br>
unencrypted. There is a risk of tracking nodes across network segments<br>
and of profiling their traffic leveraging the plaintext Partial IV. This<br>
was raised in an old issue of the OSCORE Github repository, but was<br>
considered not useful if nothing can be done about peer IDs too (e.g.,<br>
encrypting or updating those). Now we <em>have</em> a means of updating the<br>
peer IDs, see <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-core-oscore-id-update/">draft-ietf-core-oscore-id-update</a> presented before.<br>
<abbr title="Marco Tiloca">MT</abbr> (p3): The intent is to update the OSCORE RFC, i.e., <a href="/doc/rfc8613/">RFC 8613</a>. This<br>
document provides a lightweight method for encrypting the Partial IV. It<br>
works as an optional pluggable add-on. There is no in-band signaling.<br>
Using it or not is a property of Security Context that is set when<br>
establishing the Security Context (just like it is the case for the<br>
encryption algorithm). So it needs to be agreed on Security Context<br>
establishment. By default, it is NOT used, to ensure retrocompatibility.</p>
<p><abbr title="Marco Tiloca">MT</abbr> (p4-5): Describing details of how the Partial IV encryption works<br>
step-by-step. High-level: derive an additional key once and for all at<br>
Security Context establishment; after protecting a message, derive an<br>
IV_KEYSTREAM using as input the new key and some (padded) bytes taken<br>
from the message payload. The encrypted Partial IV is the XOR between<br>
IV_KEYSTREAM and the plaintext Partial IV.<br>
<abbr title="Marco Tiloca">MT</abbr> (p6): Considerations on info leakage from the Partial IV length. This<br>
solution is cryptographically safe against passive adversaries, while<br>
active adversaries have more leeway and may use side-channel attacks to<br>
figure out some info due to replay checking happening before decryption<br>
(the OSCORE processing of incoming messages is not meant to be<br>
constant-time).<br>
<abbr title="Marco Tiloca">MT</abbr> (p7): How to decide whether to use this or not is out of scope, but<br>
still it needs to be done when establishing the Security Context.<br>
Possible ways to do this will come in next versions and the draft<br>
already mentions them as placeholders.</p>
<p><abbr title="Christian Amsüss">CA</abbr>: You mentioned that encrypting the PIV only makes sense if you change<br>
the IDs. But when the IDs change the PIV resets to 0. So isn't it<br>
pointless to encrypt the PIV?<br>
<abbr title="Marco Tiloca">MT</abbr>: You may want to hide that you start again from 0. The attacker<br>
already sees that the ID has not been used yet so...<br>
<abbr title="Christian Amsüss">CA</abbr> (chat): Let's follow that offline, I think it may be easier to more<br>
often change the identifiers and start off with non-zero PIVs.<br>
<abbr title="Marco Tiloca">MT</abbr> (on chat): That would make the new ID not usable for a non-trackable<br>
network migration, and the new (not necessarily 0) Partial IV will still<br>
be shown as growing monotonically. Anyway, happy to continue discussing<br>
offline.</p>
<p><abbr title="Christian Amsüss">CA</abbr> (chat): If, of course, the key to use were set by the recipient, and<br>
the recipient could send the same key to all its peers, then also the<br>
recipient ID could be encrypted.<br>
<abbr title="Mike Bishop">MB</abbr> (chat): This feels very reminiscent of QUIC's packet number<br>
encryption. Thoughts from having survived that process: TCP deals with<br>
intermediaries that try to be helpful by inspecting packet numbers and<br>
rearranging packets. Does CoAP have a similar problem you're trying to<br>
solve here? Hardware offload paid a price for this functionality,<br>
because most NICs were not able to offload the two-step encryption. Does<br>
CoAP depend on any hardware offload that would need to be considered<br>
before doing this?<br>
<abbr title="Carsten Bormann">CB</abbr> (on chat): Christian: Why does the key need to be the same? (That<br>
creates a lot of linkability and opportunities for collusion, I think)<br>
<abbr title="Christian Amsüss">CA</abbr> (on chat): Well, if the KID field is encrypted, the server doesn't<br>
know which peer the request is coming from, can barely try all<br>
established ones.<br>
<abbr title="Carsten Bormann">CB</abbr> (on chat): I'm interested in how barely...</p>
<p><abbr title="Carsten Bormann">CB</abbr>: For TLS ECH, we have spent the last 5 years watching the TLS WG<br>
developing this based on some privacy requirements. Then things are<br>
deployed worldwide, and then discarded because they missed some more<br>
privacy considerations. We should be really careful here.<br>
<abbr title="Marco Tiloca">MT</abbr>: True and not intending to radically change vanilla OSCORE.</p>

<p><abbr title="Toerless Eckert">TE</abbr> (p2): Giving background on GRASP. Not meant to replace HTTP or CoAP.<br>
(Typo: <a href="/doc/rfc8995/">RFC8995</a> should be <a href="/doc/rfc8990/">RFC8990</a>)<br>
<abbr title="Toerless Eckert">TE</abbr> (p2): Simple CBOR, simple header, no transport/security in it (done<br>
on outside).<br>
<abbr title="Toerless Eckert">TE</abbr> (p2): Unique features: no layer of request/reply, URL etc., unless<br>
brought through fields.<br>
<abbr title="Toerless Eckert">TE</abbr> (p2): Multi-exchange transactions can be established, with failure<br>
canceling all operations. (Not just once back, once forth.)<br>
<abbr title="Toerless Eckert">TE</abbr> (p2): The second big feature is service announcement and information<br>
flooding. It works via hop-by-hop agents. We know the pain of attempting<br>
reliable multicast.<br>
<abbr title="Toerless Eckert">TE</abbr> (p3-4): CoRE interactions, options for how to take advantage of<br>
functionalities from CoAP for GRASP. We want feedback on the options.</p>
<p><abbr title="Christian Amsüss">CA</abbr>: The one I could suggest most is option 3, but as you ask about 1 and<br>
2: on 2, what do you mean for message types?<br>
<abbr title="Toerless Eckert">TE</abbr>: Method code.<br>
<abbr title="Christian Amsüss">CA</abbr>: That was last touched before I got to CoRE seriously.<br>
<abbr title="Christian Amsüss">CA</abbr>: On option 1: if you want to extract a reliability mechanism, you can<br>
alter the CoAP version field (or you do not even need to, since it is<br>
another protocol). Option 1 would be about copying out the parts of CoAP<br>
that you want.<br>
<abbr title="Toerless Eckert">TE</abbr>: Hard to hear, let's continue on the mailing list.</p>
